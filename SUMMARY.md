**Cow Lie Stand Walk Computer Vision Project** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 4932 images with 6677 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *stand*, *lie*, and *walk*.

Images in the Cow Lie Stand Walk dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (3946 images), *valid* (493 images), and *test* (493 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
